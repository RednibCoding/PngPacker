## How to play the game?
[Gothic 3 The Beginning](Gothic3-TheBeginning) is a Java Mobile Game (J2ME) so you need an emulator to play the game.

I'd recommend [KEmulator](Gothic3-TheBeginning)

The game and the emulator are in this repo located in the [Gothic 3 The Beginning folder](Gothic3-TheBeginning)
 
g3tbToImg is located in the [bin folder](bin)
