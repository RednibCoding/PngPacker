# PngPacker
PngPacker is a tool that can pack png files into a single file and also unpack png's from any file that contains png's

# How to
## Pack png files
- drag and drop a folder containing png files onto `PngPacker`
## Unpack png files
- drag and drop a packed file onto `PngPacker` (this can be any file, because whenever `PngPacker` finds png signatures, it will try to unpack the png file)
